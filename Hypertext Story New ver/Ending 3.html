        <p> With your new powers and form Freya teaches you how to navigate the world as a hybrid. Joining her side you help her
          as she turns willing vampires and witches to join her cause and become a hybrid. A few months go by and Youve acquired a large
          number of hybrid followers. Freya enacts her plans to build a city for people like her and other outcasts or unnaturals to feel
          welcome and accepted. As for Lapis last you heard she was rallying a small army to try and take now Freya but as time passes
          the rumors of that began to fade away. You havent heard or seen her since your last encounter. Freya praises you for helping her
          dream become a reality and reminds you of your tricky path of morality to get here. Feeling a tad bit better about your choices
          you realize Freya was changing for the better. But you knew your future was full of uncertainty.
