       <p>You enter the megatower and the woman at the desk greets you. You tell her you have a meeting with Freya and she points you to the elevator. upon stepping off the 
          elevator, A woman faces the window her long dark green dress flowing as she turns around, she has stunning
          emerad eyes red hair in a bun and scarlet lips. she speaks "I knew theyd send someone eventually, you
          here to kill me?" she asks curiously. she seemed like she wouldnt harm a fly. She sits at her desk and examines 
        you closely and then gives  a wicked smile. " Your newly turned. They must be desperate..But theres something different
        about" She says getting up to circle you.  She inhales deeply. " yes your special. Youve got a gift. I can help
        you unlock your potential."  she says. Before you can speak you feel something deep inside you prying to get out.
       It rises the closer Frey gets to you, Her scent  intoxicating you as your fangs instinctively show. Your hunger grows, it drowns
      out whatever speech she was giving, your pupils shift. You try to fight it, to no avail it wins. Frenzied you attack her mercilessly.
     Lapis bursts in the room finds you kneeling next Freya. Blood all over the room and your clothes and face. An expression
    of grief over your face. Lapis walks over to you. "I tried to tell you earlier, you know. She says gently picking you off the floor.
    " It happend to me too once. ended up killing on of my best friends because I tried to resist it. I can show you how to
  feed properly and humanely." She says trying to console you. Your body feels like a weight and your stomach full but full of anxiety.
" come on lets get out of here." She urges walking you to the door. Exiting the room you avoid looking at the mass of red on the floor
that used to be a person. </p>
