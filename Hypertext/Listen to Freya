        <p> You sit on a nearby chair and she lights the fireplace and sits next to you. Speaking softly she tells you that vampires are unnatural
          that they must be stopped before they wipe out not just witches but humans too. She says if you join her she can turn you into a witch hybrid
          and that youd have access to bothe vampiric powers and magic that you could take out their Clan Elder which she reveals is Lapis.
          I know shes your sire but she will not stop til everyones under her contorl. Think about it. She hands you a wooden  dagger  with beautiful roses 
          etched on the side.  I know youll make the right decision she says turning away from you. </p>
