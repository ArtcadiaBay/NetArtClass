  <p>  You place your hand on the door latch but pause and turn to lapis. " You want to kill a random woman. I deserve to know why.
    What arent you telling me." You say sternly. Lapis looks away from you at her phone. " I just told you why." she says nonchantly.
    You look at her with a glare." Lapis you can be honest. You owe it to me."  you say placing your hand on her shoulder. She looks at you
    and sighs deeply." Fine. Me and Freya have a history okay. We dated and." she pauses. " And what?" you ask curiously. Lapis  lifts
    up her shirt revealing a large Scar across her stomach. " She killed me." Lapis says her voice hoarse. You grab her hand 
    " Im sorry, but Why would she do such a thing." you ask. Her eyes go from sadness to anger. "Because she's crazy. She
    tried to turn me into a witch while I was still human. I refused and she killed me." she says gripping her necklace tightly.
    " Wait if you were human how did you survive?"I ask eyeing her curiously. " I died with vampire blood in my system. My friend
     gave me some earlier that da she felt something was wrong that day begged me not to go with Freya that night. I didnt listen.
     Turns out my friend was a vampire with the gift of premenintion." Lapis explains. " Thank you for telling me that.
     I Understand now. But you shouldnt kill her for vengance its not worth it Lapis." I say. Lapis hops out the car. " Look do what you will
     but I gave you your task. so either you do it or  Ill find someone else." She says slamming the door.
