  <p> Walking toward her slowly you grab the ice cream from the fridge. Your eyes meet, hers are icy cold yet with a 
    hidden warmth behind them.  She watches as you continue grabbing snacks and adding them to 
    your cart. The cashier rings you up and you walk out the store into the night.  Walking to your car 
    you feel a sharp sting in your neck and crumple on the ground. feeling yourself getting colder
     slipping into nothingness, She stands over you and bares her bloody fangs. 
     Everything goes black </p>
