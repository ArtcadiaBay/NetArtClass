  <h1><strong>&nbsp; Plastic tree(Azabana)</strong></h1>
  <p><em><hr>Like a butterfly that has lost its wings, the shadow stretched out, and I was just swaying at the innocent melancholy that seemed to be
  swaying, even if I knew the love of
  Baidu at night, I had no choice but to get used to it, and I couldn't go anywhere, this body, this heart,
  this heart<br></hr>
    
 <hr> goes round and round in the same place. As if chasing a
  little dust that has no exit and can never<br>
  return, I woke up from a dream I was looking at and
  I was alone
