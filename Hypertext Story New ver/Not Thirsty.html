<p> You look at her like she has three heads. " No way im feeding on another human!" you scream. Lapis rolls her eyes
    " od your one of those bleeding heart types arent you" She says sounding slighty offended. You shake your head and turned to 
the driver. Who was obviously under some kind of  spell. " Fine dont drink. But dont say I didnt warn you. " She says signaling
the driver to keep going. " what are you talking about warn of what?" you ask. " The blood will keep you from going into
a frenzy. Youll tear head off the nearest person if your hungry enough with no remorse until after youve consumed all of their

from you looking out the window. "Thats putting it mildly. Lets just get to our destination." She says seemingly bothered by the 
topic.</p>
