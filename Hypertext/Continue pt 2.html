<h1>The Hunt</h1>

<p> you awaken in loft like apartment, racing to the mirror you see your pale like a corpse
    with two puncture wounds in your neck. Realizing your a vampire a newly turned one at that. 
    The door opens the woman who turned you eclaims happily oh your awake as hands you a bag full of clothes
    change and meet me outside,and she notes for  you to call her Lapis. The clothes suit your seemingly Alternative style ripped jeans and shirt
    with worn out White stars and a pair of paint splattered combat boots. You exit the building
    and car waits for you, the door swings open and she yanks you in feeding time she yells slamming the door
    on the ride there she breaks down how to feed as a vampire be quiet and discreet.
    pulling along side a park. she rolls down the window pick she says.</p>
