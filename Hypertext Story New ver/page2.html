    <p> In the graveyard she tells you about how you can solve their worlds crissis and in exchange
        you will gain great powers. Holding out her wrist with a tattoo of red rose with an eye in the middle
        biting into her arm. Blood drips down and she looks at you excitement in her eyes, she says drink.</p>
   
        <p> " you drink her blood "  Carefully lifting her arm you lean down putting your lips to her
            wrist. The metal flavor hits you hard traveling down your throat yet you cant stop drink, She lifts 
        your head and bites your neck. The feeling is intense pure euphoria flows through your
    mind and body wishing to capture this feeling forever, you feel connected to her. placing both hands
on your face your eyes meet and she forcefully snaps your neck. </p>
</body>
<p> " You refuse her offer"   She looks at you with dissapointment says how unfortunate and that she must have
    been wrong about you. slowly patting your head she says its a shame to have to dipose of you, realizing
    what she meant you turn to run but she quickly grabs you and tears out your heart.</p>
