      <p>  You bare your fangs and hold the vial in your hands, Freya sighs and looks sadden
        by your choice and holds out her arms and the building shakes as vines come slithering from all over
        the glass window shatters and large vine pins you to the wall. Her eyes black with tiny dark veins 
        all over her face she screeches loudly in your face and you throw the vial on her face it returns
      her to her orignal form negating her magic, you stand over her and snap her neck. Proceeding to make your
    way out the building. </p>
