        <p> Seeing the lights flashing from the tower Lapis busts in the room. " What the hell is going on here?!" she yells looking at Freya hugging 
          all over you. A look of angers form on her face as Freya smiles at her. " Ah Hello to you too lapis" She giggles. " What did you do?" Lapis exclaims
          eyeing you with fury in her eyes. " She's one of us now." Freya remarks with petty grin.  You avoid lapis's burning hot gaze as you slide closer
          to the window. " Oh I get it. Your a backstabber and a freak of nature now huh?! " Lapis screams fighting back tears. Freya was obviously
          enjoying seeing her in a fit. " I was wrong about you. Dont worry Ill Finish this myself!" She yells sprinting at you. Without a second thought
          you dodge her and frey blasts her across the room. Lapis lunges at her a and bares her fangs, Freya grabs Lapis mid jump and laughs. Slamming
          her into some nearby furniture. You pull Lapis from under her and shove her out the door. " Go before she kills you." You say. " If you ever 
          try to come after me Ill end you on sight." Lapis warns. Freya pushes past you into the door way " Right back at you Lapis" She snickers. 
          Freya turns to you. " we have work to do newbie." She smiles packing up a bag of small potions and books. and Signals for you to follow.
