<h1>The Hunt</h1>

<p> you awaken in loft like apartment, racing to the mirror you see your pale like a corpse
    with two puncture wounds in your neck. Realizing your a vampire a newly turned one at that. 
    The door opens the woman who turned you eclaims happily oh your awake as hands you a bag full of clothes
    change and meet me outside,and she notes for  you to call her Lapis. The clothes suit your seemingly Alternative style ripped jeans and shirt
    with worn out White stars and a pair of paint splattered combat boots. You exit the building
    and car waits for you, the door swings open and she yanks you in feeding time she yells slamming the door
    on the ride there she breaks down how to feed as a vampire be quiet and discreet.
    pulling along side a park. she rolls down the window pick she says.</p>

    <p> "The young  female jogger" You approach the woman pretending you need help
    she quickly follows you to the quieter part of the park and you lunge at her she dodges and slips
    past you screaming for help, Lapis flies out the car charging the woman jamping her fist into her stomach
    she shakes her head at you shoddy work newbie.

<p> "The shady looking Man</p> The man looks around suspiciously as if up to no good, you decide to
approach him from behind, you startle him. He speaks his voice trembling not from fear but from
something else, you Lila? he asksd with a paranoid look in his eyes, lying through your teeth
you say yes but I wanna do this in a more secluded place. He nods and walks near the alley way. Turning away from you he pulls out
 a laptop, I have the tech you wanted I really admire your hacking skills. You bare your fangs and grab his neck
 sinking your fangs into his skin. Trying hard to not loose control you rip yourself from the man as he 
 slumps against the wall. Lapis comes over clapping great work rookie.</p>
