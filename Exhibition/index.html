     <p> In this art exhibition, there will be a series of works to view. These works have similarities in that they have used code or software and images to create the works seen before you. I was drawn to these three artworks for not only for their visual appearance but for how they were made. each has its own unique style but has a similar theme to each of them. I know two of these art pieces were inspired by music and the third was inspired by existing art. Each work was crafted by an individual person,   </p>
