       <p>You enter the megatower and the woman at the desk greets you
          you tell her you have a meeting with Freya and she points you to the elevator. upon stepping off the 
          elevator, A woman faces the window her long dark green dress flowing as she turns around, she has stunning
          emerad eyes red hair in a bun and scarlet lips. she speaks "I knew theyd send someone eventually, you
          here to kill me?" she asks curiously. she seemed like she wouldnt harm a fly. She sits at her desk and examines 
        you closely and then gives  a wicked smile. " Your newly turned. They must be desperate..But theres something different
        about" She says getting up to circle you.  She inhales deeply. " yes your special. Youve got a gift. I can help
        you unlock your potential."  she says. </p>
