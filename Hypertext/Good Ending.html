<p> You return to lapis letting her know you disposed of a Freya. Lapis hugs you saying she couldnt have done this
  without your help she reveals Freya was a power hungry tyrant who would never agree to peace. With her out of the picture they could apoint her sister Talis
   who wanted to stat a new era between the vampires and the witches. Lapis says she wanted out of the clan to travel the world and sent you on this mission
   to prove your worth to the clan. She hands you their clan sigil and say I know you will lead us to peace. Months go By and you have fully adjusted to your
   role as the clan leader. The vampires sweared their loyalty to you and you have earned their respect. Slowly spreading peace through the supernatural world 
   and creating a safe heaven for those on the run or being hunted, youve built a new city capitol called Moon Haven. Month by Month you enact your plans
   to bring about peace between witches and the Vampires even have swayed a few humans to join your cause. Eventually you figure out a plan to
   make the holy veil lest hostile to your kind, But babysteps this is just the beginning.
