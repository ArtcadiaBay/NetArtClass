<p> Lapis hugs you saying she couldnt have done this without your help. Even though you feel killing Freya was justifed. You still feel wrong
  for doing so.  " Freya mentioned I was special, different than the other vampires. Why?" You ask. Lapis smiles " You are, thats why I picked you.
  you have a very special gift and its up to you to figure out what it is and how to use it." She says looking out the window of your apartment. She assure you that you
  did the right thing. She reveals Freya was a power hungry tyrant who would never agree to peace. With her out of the picture they could apoint a new leader to
  replace Lapis. who wanted to started a new era between the vampires and the witches. Lapis says she wanted out of the clan to travel the world and sent you on this mission
   to prove your worth to the clan. She hands you their clan sigil and say I know you will lead us to peace. Months go By and you have fully adjusted to your
   role as the clan leader. The vampires sweared their loyalty to you and you have earned their respect. Slowly spreading peace through the supernatural world 
   and creating a safe heaven for those on the run or being hunted, you've built a new city capitol called Moon Haven. Month by Month you enact your plans
   to bring about peace between witches and the Vampires even have swayed a few humans to join your cause. Eventually you figure out a plan to
   make the holy veil less hostile to your kind, But babysteps this is just the beginning.
