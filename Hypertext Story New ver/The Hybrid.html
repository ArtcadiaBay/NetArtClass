        <p> You place your hand over the book, and meet Freya's eyes. She smiles ear to ear and takes your hand and cuts it with a small knife. your
          blood drips over the book. The runes glow as she enacts the spell, placing your hand on the spell book your skin tingles like you being
        zapped with a thousand bolts. A strong rush of adrealine falls over you as the spell concludes. " Welcome to the world my little hybrid" she says
      throwing her arms around you. A sense a guilt forms in the pit of your stomach but is quickly washed out by a feeling of power.</p>
